# Hello I'm Chris!

![My stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=chrisdewa&theme=radical)

I'm a dev ped from Mexico City. I love to code in python and I'm learning vue.js.

I'm interested in child development, ADHD, ASD, speech and language disorders, human evolution and natural history. 

Usually I develop discord bots and related stuff and Jupyter notebooks for my research projects.
