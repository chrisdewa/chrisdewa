# Hello I'm Chris!

![My stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=chrisdewa&theme=radical)

I'm a developmental pediatrician from Mexico City. I love to code in python and I'm always looking for the next thing to learn.

I'm interested in child development, ADHD, ASD, speech and language disorders, computer sciences, networking, human evolution, natural history and a little bit about penetration testing.

I often develop discord bots and APIs for my friends and communities I'm engaged with and I use python and Jupiter lab in my research projects and my students'.
