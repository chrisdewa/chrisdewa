# Hello I'm Chris!

I'm a Developmental Pediatrician from Mexico City.
Yes, you read that right. I'm also neurodiverse, I have ADHD and Hyperfocus is my superpower.

What am I doing here? Well, ever since i was like 3 years I've had a special relationship with computers, i love to code, usually on python, although I'm also learning R, kotlin and node.js.

I use programming only scarsely in my practice as I mostly do it for fun, although i do have some useful jupyter notebooks to process some neurodevelopmental tests and other research projects.

Usually I program discord related things on python, but i also like to do some backend stuff.
